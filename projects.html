<h2>My Recent Project</h2>
<p>My most recent project was the Environmental Quiz I made on Python. It consisted of 10 questions based on topics based around the environment. These topics consisted of: Climate Change, Energy, Recycling, Carbon Emissions & Pollution. The original outline for the code was for it to have a working scoreboard at the end of it. However due to time constraints, I didn't add the scoreboard. But overall it works very well, just wish that I could've added more features to it.</p>

<p>This here is my flowchart for my code. As you can see it is fairly simple, due to the simplicity of the program. And also what we have above is the first question being ran. As you can see the question gives out 4 multiple choices. I got the answer correct to display what happens if you do get the answer correct. My score is now 1 because of this, if I got the answer wrong then I would've stayed on 0.</p>
